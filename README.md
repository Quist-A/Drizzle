# Drizzle

## Thesis
The files in this repository belong to the Bachelor's Thesis of Arend-Jan Quist.
The following files belong to the following sections in the thesis:
2.1.5 -- Drizzle.py.
2.1.6 -- Drizzle_timeits.ipynb
3.3.3 -- Artificial_datasets_without_upscaling_number_of_pixels.ipynb
4.2   -- Artificial_datasets_with_upscaling_number_of_pixels.ipynb

## Contents
Drizzle.py consists of drizzle implementations.
Drizzle_timeits.ipynb measures time duration of the implementations in Drizzle.py.
Artificial_datasets_without_upscaling_number_of_pixels.ipynb and Artificial_datasets_with_upscaling_number_of_pixels.ipynb create artificial datasets and drizzle them for various parameters.
Shift_detection_for_artificial_datasets.ipynb and Registration.py calculate the shifts of images in Artificial_datasets_with_upscaling_number_of_pixels.ipynb.
